This project explores portfolio optimization using R to construct a portfolio that minimizes risk while maintaining comparable returns to the S&P 500. The workflow begins with selecting 25 stocks based on technical indicators, such as the 50-week moving average staying consistently above the 200-week moving average and resilience during downturns. Historical price data from 2009 to 2022 was retrieved using Yahoo Finance, and annual log returns, Sharpe ratios (risk-adjusted returns using a 2.28% risk-free rate), and excess kurtosis (to evaluate distribution tails) were computed for each stock. The top 10 stocks, ranked by Sharpe ratios, were selected for the portfolio. 

An equal-weighted portfolio was constructed, assigning 10% weight to each of the selected stocks, yielding an annual return of 17.64%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 10.51%, and a volatility of 0.1199, slightly lower than the S&P 500’s 0.1205.

To further reduce risk, the efficient frontier was plotted to illustrate the trade-off between risk and return by varying portfolio weights. Using Modern Portfolio Theory, the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) was calculated by minimizing the covariance matrix among the 10 stocks, achieving a volatility of 0.0415 and an annual return of 9.79%. The results demonstrate the potential to significantly reduce portfolio risk while maintaining reasonable returns. This project highlights the effectiveness of data-driven optimization techniques in outperforming benchmarks like the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. 

Future iterations will explore stock selections targeting returns of 20–25% while maintaining similar risk levels and implement restrictions on short sales to enhance practical asset management. The complete R code implementation, including data processing, performance metrics, and optimization techniques, is available in this repository for further exploration.
